              Goatforce is a CRM dashboard powered by MCP (Model Context
              Protocol) servers, designed to be the one-stop shop for sales reps
              to manage their deals efficiently. The core idea was to eliminate
              the friction between different tools and create a unified
              interface that understands natural language commands.
            </p>
            <p>
              The challenge was building a lightweight interface that could
              handle complex sales workflows while maintaining speed and
              reliability. We used MCP servers to bridge the gap between natural
              language processing and CRM operations, allowing sales reps to
              simply type what they want to accomplish rather than navigating
              through multiple screens and forms.

            Why MCP Servers
          </h2>

          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              Goatforce was built entirely leveraging MCP servers for seamless
              integration with Salesforce APIs. The MCP architecture allows for
              real-time data synchronization, automated deal tracking, and
              intelligent workflow management. By using MCP servers, we could
              maintain context across complex multi-step sales processes while
              ensuring data consistency and reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
              The MCP server's strength lies in handling complex action chains
              without losing track of the sales pipeline. For example, when a
              sales rep types "update this deal to closed-won and schedule
              follow-up with the client," the system can execute multiple
              operations while adapting to changing CRM states and maintaining
              proper data relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
              We tuned the compute allocation based on task complexity - giving
              minimal processing power for simple data updates and more
              computational resources for complex multi-step workflows. This
              approach balanced speed with reliability, ensuring that simple
              operations remained fast while complex processes had sufficient
              resources to complete successfully.
