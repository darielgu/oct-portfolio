              Interview Prep is a comprehensive platform that transforms the
              stressful process of interview preparation into a streamlined,
              data-driven experience. The core idea was to eliminate guesswork
              by providing candidates with deep insights into their specific
              interviewer, company and position requirements.
            </p>

              Using the parralel api as a Claude sdk tool we were able to scrape
              the interviewers linkedin, the company & positions most asked
              questions, core values, and any other data on the internet that
              could give you a better chance at getting hired. On generation we
              provide the user a comprehensive study guide on how to ace their
              interview.

              This was built in 5 hours @ the UCSD x SDx hackathon, which was
              honestly our biggest challenge. That 5 hour time crunch meant no
              going back on our original plan and pushing out code every couple
              of minutes. All in all it was a great experience getting to meet
              some of the UCSD students.
