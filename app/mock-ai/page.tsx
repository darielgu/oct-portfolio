              Mock AI won the SDSU x AWS Ai hackathon! It is a interview
              simulation platform that provides comprehensive feedback on
              candidates' performance across multiple dimensions. The core idea
              was to create a realistic interview environment that could
              evaluate not just answers, but also tone, body language, and
              facial expressions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We used Next & TypeScript, Fastapi, base 64, Amazon bedrock,
              dynamo, lambda, & transcribe!

            Challenges Encountered

              The biggest challenge was creating realistic interview scenarios
              that could adapt to different industries and roles. We implemented
              dynamic question generation based on job descriptions, resume, and
              company culture, ensuring that each mock interview felt authentic
              and relevant to the candidate's target position.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, we faced the challenge of providing actionable feedback
              that candidates could actually use to improve. Rather than just
              scoring performance, we developed detailed analysis systems that
              provide specific recommendations for improvement, including
              practice exercises and targeted coaching suggestions.
