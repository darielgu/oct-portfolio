            <p>
              Coming from a first gen background I had 0 idea what an enterprise
              company would look/feel like. The scale was unlike anything I'd
              experienced before, it's crazy to imagine the software begin
              Salesforce powers millions of users
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a great experience to feel SF's ai/builder culture and
              explore the city. I was able to visit Roblox for their open house,
              Reddit for a Colorstack event, & learn so much from my
              manager/mentor
            </p>

              <strong>Performance matters at scale:</strong> What seems like a
              minor optimization can have massive impact when multiplied across
              millions of users.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Documentation is everything:</strong> In a large
              organization, clear documentation is essential.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Customer feedback drives innovation:</strong> Real user
              pain points are the foundation for new features.
