              This summer was transformative. Landing an internship at
              Salesforce felt like a dream come true, but I had no idea just how
              much it would shape my perspective on the tech industry
            </p>
            <p>
              Coming from a first gen background I had 0 idea what an enterprise
              company would look/feel like. The scale was unlike anything I'd
              experienced before, it's crazy to imagine changes to the platform
              would affect millions of users
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a great experience to feel SF's ai/builder culture. I was
              able to visit Roblox for their open house, Reddit for a Colorstack
              event, & learn so much from my mangaer/mentor
            </p>

              <strong>Performance matters at scale:</strong> What seems like a
              minor optimization can have massive impact when multiplied across
              millions of users.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Documentation is everything:</strong> In a large
              organization, clear documentation is essential.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Customer feedback drives innovation:</strong> Real user
              pain points are the foundation for new features.
