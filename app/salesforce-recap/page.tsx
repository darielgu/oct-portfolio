              This summer was transformative. Landing an internship at
              Salesforce felt like a dream come true, but I had no idea just how
              much it would shape my perspective on technology, teamwork, and
              what it means to build products that impact millions of users
              worldwide.

              From day one, I was thrown into the deep end of enterprise
              software development. The scale was unlike anything I'd
              experienced before - we weren't just building features, we were
              architecting systems that needed to handle massive data loads
              while maintaining 99.9% uptime for customers who depend on our
              platform for their daily operations.

              <strong>Performance matters at scale:</strong> What seems like a
              minor optimization can have massive impact when multiplied across
              millions of users. The Redis caching implementation I built
              reduced load times from 1-2 seconds to near-instantaneous,
              dramatically improving user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Documentation is everything:</strong> In a large
              organization, clear documentation isn't just helpful - it's
              essential. I spent significant time improving our internal docs,
              and the positive feedback from other teams reinforced how
              important this work is.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Customer feedback drives innovation:</strong> Sitting in
              on customer calls and reading support tickets gave me insights
              that no amount of technical analysis could provide. Real user pain
              points became the foundation for feature prioritization.
